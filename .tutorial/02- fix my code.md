```python
from flask import Flask, request # Didn't import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/', methods=["GET"])
def index():
  get = request.args # Didn't request the args and assign to a variable
  if get["name"].lower() == "david": # Wrong variable name used
    return "Hello baldie"

  return "No data" # No return for if the page is empty

app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=81)
```
